This format for storing these data is not ideal for two reasons.
Firstly, it is not efficient; the parent information is repeated
data set itself has a “flat” structure. The data set of family members
once; if more than one copy exists, then it is possible for the copies
to disagree. The DRY principle (Section 2.7) applies to data as well
over and over again. This repetition is also undesirable because 
it creates opportunities for errors and inconsistencies to creep in. 
Ideally, each individual piece of information would be stored exactly 
as code. The second problem is not as obvious, but is arguably much
more important. The fundamental structure of most plain text file 
formats means that each line of the file contains exactly one record 
or case in the data set. This works well when a data set only contains 
information about one type of object, or, put another way, when the 
does not have a flat structure. There is information about two different 
types of object, parents and children, and these objects have a definite
