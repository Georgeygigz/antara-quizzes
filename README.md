1. Write an algorithm (in any language of your choice or pseudo-code) to merge two sorted linked lists. Think about the efficiency of your approach and indicate the complexity of your algorithm.

- Then time complexity of the linked list algorithm os 0(n)(Linear) because the execution time will increase with increase in the number of inputs

2. The time complexity of the second question on removing duplicated line on a file, is 0(n)(linear)
