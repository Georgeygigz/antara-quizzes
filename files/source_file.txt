This format for storing these data is not ideal for two reasons.
Firstly, it is not efficient; the parent information is repeated

to disagree. The DRY principle (Section 2.7) applies to data as well
over and over again. This repetition is also undesirable because 
it creates opportunities for errors and inconsistencies to creep in.

does not have a flat structure. There is information about two different
